    <h2>Ensign Talk: The Immediate Goodness of God</h2>
    <h4>By Elder Kyle S. McKay Of the Seventy</h4>      

    <div class="news">
    <p>Above all, God’s love is immediate. With Paul, I testify that nothing can “separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus.”9 Even our sins, though they may separate us from His Spirit for a time, cannot separate us from the constancy and immediacy of His divine paternal love.

        </p>

    <p>These are some of the ways and means by which “he doth immediately bless [us].”10 Now, to bring these principles current and close, I share with you the experiences of two people whose lives stand as testaments of the immediate goodness of God.
